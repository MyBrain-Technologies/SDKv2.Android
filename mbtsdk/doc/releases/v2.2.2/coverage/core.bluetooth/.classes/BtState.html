<i>14</i>&nbsp; * The Bluetooth current state describes the state of connection between a headset device and a mobile device.
<i>15</i>&nbsp; * As the SDK needs to perform specific operations according to the value of the current connection state, the BtState enum provides all the possible states to the Bluetooth unit Manager.
<i>16</i>&nbsp; * All the states are classified in a chronological order in this Enum, except those that we consider as a &quot;failure state&quot;.
<i>17</i>&nbsp; * These failure states are assigned if something went wrong during the Bluetooth connection process,
<i>18</i>&nbsp; * In this case, the operation is stopped and the headset is disconnected.
<i>19</i>&nbsp; * The failure that happened is always transmitted to the SDK via the current state variable contained in the MbtBluetoothLE or MbtBluetoothSPP class.
<i>20</i>&nbsp; * During a connection, we consider that the current state is a failure state if CONNECTED_AND_READY state state has not be reached.
<i>21</i>&nbsp; * The SDK user is notified for every failure that stop a started connection process through the onError method.
<i>22</i>&nbsp; * This method returns the failure in a BaseError type object that describe the origin of the failure in details.
